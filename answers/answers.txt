from pokemons p
LEFT JOIN pokemon_trainer pt on p.id = pt.pokemon_id
LEFT JOIN trainers tr on pt.trainerID = tr.trainerID
LEFT JOIN types t on p.primary_type = t.id
LEFT JOIN types tp on p.secondary_type = tp.id;


mysql> Select p.name as 'Pokemon Name', tr.trainername as 'Trainer Name', pt.pokelevel as 'Level', t.name as 'Primary Type', tp.name as 'Secondary Type'
from pokemons p
LEFT JOIN pokemon_trainer pt on p.id = pt.pokemon_id
LEFT JOIN trainers tr on pt.trainerID = tr.trainerID
LEFT JOIN types t on p.primary_type = t.id
LEFT JOIN types tp on p.secondary_type = tp.id
